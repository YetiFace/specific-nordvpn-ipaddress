There's not a lot to this. 

1. Add the `connect.sh` file to your computer. 
2. Edit the `DESIREDIP` and `NORDSERVER` variables to your taste.
3. Run the script!* 

*_You can either do this via the terminal in the file's directory `./connect.sh` or making sure the file has executable permissions (once again from a terminal in the file's directory: `chmod +x connect.sh`) and then double clicking it._
